Goal is to make a python script that reads from a csv, creds, ips, and hostnames, and will execute scripts. Pet project that probably won't see use

python3 comptroller.py sample.csv main.sh

use the script to setup SSH on a machime, just copy/paste it lol or curl it

to set up pubkey run `ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa` local, get ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub onto remote host

`sudo sed -i 's/^#PubkeyAuthentication yes/PubkeyAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd`

todo: look into pub key authenitcation for a single user (denable pub key authentication, disable for every single user that isnt our backdoor user)
